At this homework, please run main.py
When you run it, you will follow the question to do a casher process in supermarket.

At NH is duty free state, so is 0 tax.
At MA food and clothing is empty tax, but other else will charge 6.25% tax.
At ME food is empty tax, clothing and other else will charge 5.5% tax.

So I created a small data and save as goodsList.csv file to use in this program.
There are three types of goods in goodsList.csv
food, clothing and else

customer can shop in the store repeated multiple times and get the final cost.
the total price = quantities * prices + tax
